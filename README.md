# Java_GUI-Game
A Java game created in my Java class at NJIT.  
A trivia game that asks you three questions per round.
This game requires two people to play in order to function. 
When trying to connect to the server, it is expected to type in "localhost". 
From there, you have a timer timing how long you have to answer each question.  
Over 25 randomized question possibilities. 
A scorekeeper on the side. 
A type in the box feature. 
as well as a submit box. 
All you need to do is dowload the teo jar files and double clikc on the game window and type in 
local host to play!!
